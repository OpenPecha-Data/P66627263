Damchen Chitor: A Brief Practice of Torma Offering to the Oath-Bound Guardians1
by Minling Terchen Gyurme Dorjé

Om siddhirastu!
Paying homage to the supreme lama, inseparable from the yidam deity, and the infinite hosts
of oath-bound guardians, I shall briefly set out, for the sake of beginners, the activities
of offering torma to delight these guardians.
Those wishing to offer tormas to the oath-bound guardians should, in an agreeable location,
clean and arrange representations of enlightened forms, such as Avalokiteśvara. Then, in the
three torma receptacles place decorated tormas of the lama and yidam inseparably united,
the wisdom protector Mahākāla, and the oath-bound terma guardians and local deities, together
with the medicinal nectar (men), rakta, and seven offering bowls. Place in front of
yourself the inner offerings, vajra and bell, skulldrum, flowers and all the necessary articles.
Having practised the self yoga as a preliminary, purify the offerings and tormas with
raṃ, yaṃ and khaṃ and then recite the following:
ram yam kham tongpé ngang lé yam lé lung ram lé mé kham lé migö gyepu sum la tenpé
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ! From the state of emptiness, out of yaṃ there arises wind, out of raṃ there arises
fire, and out of khaṃ there appears a tripod of three human skulls.
a yik lé jungwé töpé nö du chü tamché hung om so ang hah | mum lam mam pam tam lé dütsi nga
dang drönma ngar gyurpa sosö sabön gyi tsenpa dang chepé
Upon this tripod, out of a syllable A, there are appears a skull, its contents transformed through
hūṃ oṃ swa ang hah and mum lam mam pam tam into the five nectars and five lamps, each
marked with their own seed syllable.
ok gi lung yö mé bar dzé tamché shyu shying drepé teng gi namkha la om ah hung gi yigé sum nepa
le tröpé özer gyi deshyin shekpa tamché kyi tukka né
As the wind stirs beneath them, fire blazes up, melting and mixing all the substances. In the
sky above are the three syllables oṃ āḥ hūṃ, emanating rays of light to invoke wisdom nectar
from the hearts of all the buddhas.
yeshe kyi dütsi kuk yigé sum la tim té rimpar shyuwa lé damtsik gi dzé dang ro chik tu gyur
The wisdom nectar is absorbed into the three syllables, and they gradually melt, mixing inseparably
with the samaya substances.
As you consider this, bless the offerings in the following way: raise your left hand and purify
with oṃ, raise your right hand and increase with āḥ, cup your hands together and, with
hūṃ, transform them so that they take on the most excellent colour, scent and taste, and,
with the mudrā of the garuda and the syllable ho, are transformed into immaculate nectar.
om ah hung ho
Then for the invitation of the guests
rang gi nyinggé hung lé özer chakkyü nampachen lok khyukpa tar tröpé pal yeshe kyi gönpo sok
damchen chamdral kadö khor dang chepa tamché
From the syllable hūṃ at my heart appear hook-shaped rays of light, streaking out like lightning,
to invoke the glorious wisdom protectors and oath-bound guardians, together with their
consorts, retinues and attendants.
rangshyin chö kyi ying lé gyutrul gyi rolpa shyitrö nyam dumar charwa namtrul sam gyi mi khyabpé
köpa chenpö dün gyi namkhar benza samadza
They arise out of the dharmadhātu, and appear in a display of magical forms, some peaceful,
some wrathful. They all gather in the sky before me, in a vast array that defies the imagination.
Vajra samāja.

The deities send out rays of light from the hollow vajra tubes arising from hūṃ in their tongues
of the deities, collect the essence of the tormas and consume them.
Consider this and open upwards the vajra palms mudrā.

This brief practice of offering torma to the oath-bound guardians (Damchen Chitor) was composed
for convenient daily practice by the vidyādhara Gyurme Dorjé at the Potala hill in Lhasa.
The supplements provided by Khenchen Odiyana, and the torma offering and concluding rituals
and so on which have been written according to the oral tradition of Minling Terchen, are
all arranged together here in one text. Virtue!
Sarva mangalam!
